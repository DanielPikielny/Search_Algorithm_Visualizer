# Search_Algorithm_Visualizer
This project is a C++ application that visualizes several classic search algorithms on both a maze and a graph. The program uses the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) to provide a graphical user interface where users can select and observe the execution of different pathfinding algorithms.
